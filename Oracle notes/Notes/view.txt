 Views:

-Database Objects  - means it stores in database until it drops from db.

-Virtual table/Mirror image of an table

-drop the base table- view becomes invalid

-drop the view- base table becomes not affected.

Advantages:
 
-Security---No table name reflect when you fetch records from base table.

-doesn't store any data-- so no memory cosumtion

-view will provide row level, column level and table level access to the table data.

- you can store any complex query in view.


Types of views:

1)Updatable and non-updatable views

when you insert recoed in view so it affects base table that is updatable
 and when your view is created using following things
-group by
-order by
-distinct clause
-any complex query using join 
whenever you update your view table but not affect the base table.

2)simple and complex views:
simple view using simple query and complex view using complex query. 
or we can say that simple - updatable and complex is non updatable.
3)read only views

-create view v1 as select * from ee with read only
it is non updatable view

4)force views

if base table is not present then also you can create view.

create force view v11 as selet * from ud15;
