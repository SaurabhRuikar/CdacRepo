 Index:
- When you want any column many time for search at that column you create index.
- No need to crate index on primary key because By deafult indexes are created for primary key. 
- When it is created special look up table is created imlicitly it contains keywords and address of that keywords.
- Efficiency is less for insert and update and delete command as compare to select.
-  When indexing is not their then search engine go and compare the each record that is called as flat file search. 

  create index ind_name
  on tab_name(col_name);

	example: CREATE INDEX idx1 ON ee(deptno);

	Types of indexing:

	simple 
	composite
	Unique
	nonunique
	reverse
	b tree
	bitmap
	function based index

	Simple index:
	CREATE INDEX IDX2 ON ee(deptno);

Compound index:
	CREATE INDEX IDX1 ON ee(deptno,ename);
Unique Index:
	CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IDX3 ON ee(ename);
Non-Unique Index:
	CREATE Unique INDEX IDX4 ON ee(sal);

Bit Map and B Tree:

Cardinality of a particular column
= No of Distinct Rows/Total no of record

so for empno cardinality is = 14/14=1 (Because Primary Key)
called as highest cardinality.

job cardinality = 5/14=0.357----------(Lowest Cardinality)

Highest Cardinality: used b-Tree index
Lowest Cardinality:  Used bit map index
