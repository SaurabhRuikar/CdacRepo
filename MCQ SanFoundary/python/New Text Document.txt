NOTES


1)	The following example shows the usage of istitle() method.

	#!/usr/bin/python

	str = "This Is String Example...Wow!!!";
	print str.istitle()

	str = "This is string example....wow!!!";
	print str.istitle()



2)	.lstrip()
	This method returns a copy of the string in which all chars have been stripped from the beginning of the string (default whitespace characters).


3)	Description
	The method maketrans() returns a translation table that maps each character in the intabstring into the character at the same position in the outtab string. Then this table is passed to the translate() function.

	Note - Both intab and outtab must have the same length.

	Syntax
	Following is the syntax for maketrans() method -

	str.maketrans(intab, outtab)
	Parameters
	intab - This is the string having actual characters.

	outtab - This is the string having corresponding mapping character.

	Return Value
	This method returns a translate table to be used translate() function.

	Example
	The following example shows the usage of maketrans() method. Under this, every vowel in a string is replaced by its vowel position -

	#!/usr/bin/python

	from string import maketrans   # Required to call maketrans function.

	intab = "aeiou"
	outtab = "12345"
	trantab = maketrans(intab, outtab)

	str = "this is string example....wow!!!"
	print str.translate(trantab)
	When we run above program, it produces following result -

	th3s 3s str3ng 2x1mpl2....w4w!!!
